        <h2>The why, the where, and the what of successful tree planting</h2>
        <p>Trees offer many benefits to homeowners and the communities in which they live, from shade and beauty to privacy, windbreak, and lower energy bills. But these benefits are only enjoyed when you plant the right tree in the right place. Thats because the space we have available for new trees often dictates how well that tree will grow and how it will be managed over time.</p>
